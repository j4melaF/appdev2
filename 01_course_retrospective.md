## 1. What Went Well

I was able to understand and apply *Git commands* effectively during our group project.

Our team successfully *completed the web project;* although we went off track at times, we still managed to finish it and implement reusable components properly.

I somehow improved my *management skills*.

## 2. What Went Wrong / Challenges

I struggled with *asynchronous operations,* particularly during practical exams, such as working with async/await. I also encountered API call errors whose causes were sometimes unclear to me.

CSS styling for responsive layouts was challenging, especially when dynamically aligning components.

On my group, I noticed that we all do some work last minute.

During group work, we experienced some early *communication issues,* which resulted in minor delays in progress.

## 3. Key Learnings

I gained a deeper understanding of *Git commands,*.

I learned the importance of clearly understanding the system or project goals before starting the coding process.

I improved my *team collaboration and leadership skills,* including conflict handling and effective task delegation.

## 4. Areas for Improvement

I need to practice API integration and proper coding practice.

I aim to enhance my *CSS and layout skills,* particularly in building responsive designs.

I need to improve my *time management and communication skill* to avoid last-minute pressure during group projects and have a better communication with the stakeholder.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)

I hope to learn the *fundamentals of React Native* and how to adapt our web projects into mobile applications.

I want to understand Expo tools, mobile navigation, and best practices for mobile UI/UX design.

I aim to become more comfortable using *TypeScript* as we transition from JavaScript.
